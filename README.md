Module6 challenge assignment

# Overview

This project involves data from two separate APIs to gather weather and local hotel information from cities around the world

## Data

The data used in this analysis includes information about different weather metrics in multiple cities around the world. Data gathered includes the maximum temperature, wind speed, humidity, cloudiness level, at several hundred random cities.

## Analysis

The data is accumulated from the APIs listed below. 

## Dependencies

To run this analysis, you will need the following Python packages:
- pandas
- pathlib
- numpy
- scipy
- citipy

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/JGraves79/Weather-challenge.git  
cd Weather-challenge  
Open the `WeatherPy_complete.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.  
to run the API extract, you will need to create an API from http://api.openweathermap.org

Open the `VacationPy_complete.ipynb` Jupiter Notebook.
to run the API extract, you will need to create an API from https://api.geoapify.com
Run the cells to perform the analysis.

## Results

The results of the analysis provide insights into how different factors such as school type, size, and spending impact student performance. This information can be used to make data-driven decisions to improve educational outcomes.
